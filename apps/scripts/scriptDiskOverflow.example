WRITE	DATA	4096charactertest: I am writing about "Helping Children in Trouble", which addresses 1940s problems that children face, such as mental health and proper education. This pamphlet is interesting because it details the discovery and growing importance of childhood mental health and the issues or traumas that children face. It focuses on helping everyday children who may be facing challenges which are not severe enough to have them go to jail or be severely penalized, but the child who may be often reprimanded in class and unable to reach their full potential to be the same as other boys in class. Learning that psychology was seen as a male dominated science during the time is very interesting to me, because it is different from the social and female dominated field of treatment that psychology is today. The scientific aspect of psychologists being "equal" in facts to doctors during this time period to other types is surprising to me. I wonder why and when the field changed to be female dominated and less "scientific" or repeated occurred. Additionally, childhood mental health is of importance to Americans today, and both parents and schools do focus heavily on having assemblies and health education for children to help their mental health.
